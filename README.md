# Project 1
This project is for the module IT3910E of SoICT, Hanoi University of Science and Technology. In this project, I implemented manually 2 algorithms: Decision Tree and Logistic Regression. The implementation can be seen in the decision_tree.py and logistic_regression.py. I used 3 datasets to check the performance of my models, and then compare it to the pre-built models of sklearn. The raw, unprocessed data can be viewed in folder data/raw, and the processed data can be viewed in folder data/processed. In data folder, there are also 3 Jupiter Notebook files for handling the processing of each data sets. Finally, the decision_tree.ipynb and logistic_regression.ipynb is where I checked the performance of my custom models, and compared it to the sklearn's model.
